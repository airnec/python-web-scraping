This project is solely for demonstration purposes and has been built upon what is taught in an AppBrewery course.

The main idea behind is to go ahead to a webpage, get the data, and use it to show something.

It contains the following basics:\
--> Opening external webpage using ```requests``` package\
--> Parsing the source code by ```Beautiful Soup``` package\
--> List comprehensions\
--> Diving into ```html``` page using ```Beautiful Soup``` methods\
--> for loop\
--> if statement
